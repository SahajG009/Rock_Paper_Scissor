# Rock - Paper - Scissor

I have developed a rock-paper-scissors game in Python. The game allows two players to compete against each other by selecting either rock, paper, or scissors. The rules of the game are as follows:

**1. Rock beats scissors:** If one player chooses rock and the other chooses scissors, the player with rock wins.

**2. Scissors beat paper:** If one player chooses scissors and the other chooses paper, the player with scissors wins.

**3. Paper beats rock:** If one player chooses paper and the other chooses rock, the player with paper wins.

# Features of the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:

**1. Player Input:** The game prompts each player to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) through the command line interface.

**2. Randomized Computer Player:** If only one player is participating, the other player's choice is randomized by the computer.

**3. Determining the Winner:** The game evaluates the choices made by both players and determines the winner based on the rules mentioned above.

**4. Displaying Results:** The game displays the choices made by each player and announces the winner or a tie.

**5. Replay Option:** After a game is finished, players can choose to play again or exit the game.

# How it Works:
**1. Player Input:** The game prompts the players to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) one by one.

**2. Randomized Computer Player:** If only one player is participating, the computer randomly selects its choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

**3. Determining the Winner:** The game compares the choices made by the players and determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

**4. Displaying Results:** The game displays the choices made by each player and announces the winner or a tie.

**5. Replay Option:** After displaying the results, the game asks the players if they want to play again. If yes, the game starts over from step 1. If not, the game exits.

# Example Gameplay:
**Player 1:** Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): rock

**Player 2:** Please enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors): paper

Player 1 chose rock.
Player 2 chose paper.

Paper beats rock. Player 2 wins!

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ______
